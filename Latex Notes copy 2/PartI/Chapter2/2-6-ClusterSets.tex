We now define two sets of sets with the first set of sets representing the row clusters and the second set of sets representing the column clusters.  Each set of sets is composed of sets which represent the members of each row or column cluster.


\subsection{Row Cluster Set}

The "\emph{Row Cluster Set}" is a set of $\mathfrak{u} \in \Z^+$ sets with each component set representing one of the $\mathfrak{u}$ row clusters.  We will denote this set of sets as $\mathbb{U}^\star$ and formally describe it as

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{U}^\star = \Bigl\{ \mathbb{U}^\star_1, \mathbb{U}^\star_2, \dots, \mathbb{U}^\star_\mathfrak{u} \Bigr\}
\end{align*}

where the $\mathbb{U}^\star_\mu$ are sets which contain the members of the $\mu$th row cluster, with $\mu \in \left[ 1, \mathfrak{u} \right] \subset \Z^+$.  Each of the $\mathbb{U}^\star_\mu$ is constructed from the $\left\{ \mathbb{U}_i, \mathbb{M}_i \right\}$ of its (the $\mathbb{U}^\star_\mu$) constituent elements via a process we will describe later.


\subsection{Column Cluster Set}

The "\emph{Column Cluster Set}" is a set of $\mathfrak{v} \in \Z^+$ sets with each component set representing one of the $\mathfrak{v}$ column clusters.  We will denote this set of sets as $\mathbb{V}^\star$ and formally describe it as

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{V}^\star = \Bigl\{ \mathbb{V}^\star_1, \mathbb{V}^\star_2, \dots, \mathbb{V}^\star_\mathfrak{v} \Bigr\}
\end{align*}

where the $\mathbb{V}^\star_\nu$ are sets which contain the members of the $\nu$th column cluster, with $\nu \in \left[ 1, \mathfrak{v} \right] \subset \Z^+$.  Each of the $\mathbb{V}^\star_\nu$ is constructed from the $\left\{ \mathbb{V}_j, \mathbb{N}_j \right\}$ of its (the $\mathbb{V}^\star_\nu$) constituent elements via a process we will describe later.
