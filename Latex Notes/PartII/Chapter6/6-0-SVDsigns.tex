The SVD Signs Algorithm has algorithm has eight steps of its own and one step it shares with the SVD Gaps Algorithm.  The step shared between the   These steps are

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the $k$th order approximate SVD of $\mat{A}$.
\item Compare the row sign patterns.
\item Complete the row cluster's sets.
\item Create single sets for each row cluster.
\item Compare the column sign patterns.
\item Complete the column cluster's sets.
\item Create single sets for each column cluster.
\item Reorder $\mat{A}$ so that rows and columns from the same cluster have indices which are adjacent.
\end{enumerate}
